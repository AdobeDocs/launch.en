# Data element types

A data element type library module has one goal: retrieve a piece of data. How this piece of data is retrieved is up to you. For example, you can use a data element type to allow Adobe Experience Platform Launch users to retrieve a piece of data from local storage, a cookie, or a DOM element.

The module exports should look like this:

```js
module.exports = function(settings) { ... };
```

Consider a situation where you want to allow users to retrieve a piece of data from a local storage item named `productName`. Your module may look like this:

```js
module.exports = function(settings) {
  return localStorage.getItem('productName');
}
```

If you want to make the local storage item name configurable by the Platform Launch user, you can allow the user to input a name and then save the name to the `settings` object. The object might look something like this:

```js
{
  itemName: "campaignId"
}
```

In order to operate on the user-defined local storage item name, your module would need to change to this:

```js
module.exports = function(settings) {
  return localStorage.getItem(settings.itemName);
}
```

## Default value support

Be aware that users have the option to configure a default value for any data element. If your data element library module returns a value of `undefined` or `null`, it will be automatically replaced by the default value the user has configured for the data element.

## Contextual event data

If the data element is being retrieved as a result of a rule being triggered (for example, data elements are used in the conditions and actions of the rule), a second argument will be passed to your module which contains contextual information regarding the event that fired the rule. It may be beneficial in certain cases and can be accessed as follows:

```js
module.exports = function(settings, event) {
  // event contains information regarding the event that fired the rule
};
```

The `event` object must contain the following properties:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `$type` | A string describing the extension name and event name, joined using a period. For example, `youtube.play`. |
| `$rule` | An object containing information about the currently executing rule. The object must contain the following sub-properties:<ul><li>`id`: The ID of the currently executing rule.</li><li>`name`: The name of the currently executing rule.</li></ul> |

The extension providing the event type that triggered the rule may optionally add any other useful information to this `event` object.
