# Experience Cloud organization setup

>**Note**: Adobe Experience Platform Launch is being rebranded as a suite of data collection technologies in Experience Platform. These changes will be rolling out across all product documentation in the coming weeks. Please refer to the following [document](/help/launch-name-updates.md) for a consolidated reference of the terminology changes.

The first step in developing extensions in Adobe Experience Platform Launch is to register an Adobe Experience Cloud organization.

Experience Cloud customers are assigned an organization when contracts are signed. If you fall into this category, you can skip this document and proceed to the guide on [granting user access for extension development](./access.md).

If you are not an Experience Cloud customer, you can have an organization created by joining one of the Adobe partner programs listed below.

## Exchange Partner Program

This program is for partners who have technology that's complimentary to Adobe and can be integrated with Adobe technologies to add value to our mutual customers. This program maintains a [marketplace](https://www.adobeexchange.com/experiencecloud.html) where partners can create listings that promote their integrations. You can see the registration guide [here](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/experiencecloud/reg-guide.html) and you can begin your registration [here](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/experiencecloud/prereg.html).

You must be a member of this program in order to create public Launch extensions _with listings_ that will show in the marketplace.

>[!WARNING]
>
>If you register for the Exchange Partner Program at the link above, you may notice language regarding a fee charged when joining as an Innovate partner after six months. This fee **does not apply** to Launch extension developers who are joining the Exchange program solely to create extensions. You will not be charged any fees.

## Solution Partner Program (SPP)

This program is for (1) consulting firms that help Adobe customers make the most of their investments and (2) partners that resell Adobe solutions.  See the registration guide [here](https://spark.adobe.com/page/7PKZzIJJjkcDd/) or begin your registration [here](https://solutionpartners.adobe.com/home.html).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Solution Partners must also [register](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/experiencecloud/prereg.html) for the Exchange Partner Program as the Exchange agreement contains the terms and conditions for Launch extension development.
>
>Before you complete your Exchange registration, please email the Exchange admin at <ExchangeHelpEC@adobe.com> and explain that you are registering so that you can promote your Launch extension. If you don't do this, they will likely deny your application and suggest you are a better fit for the SPP. 
>
>Currently your corporate email can only be used in one partner program at a time, so you will need to use a different corporate email as the registered contact for each of the programs.

Once your company is in the Exchange Partner program, you can request access to Adobe Solutions by signing in to the [Exchange Partner Site](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/experiencecloud) and following the steps below. If you already have an Experience Cloud Account and access to solutions, but you don't have access to Launch, please see the instructions for setting up groups and users [here](../../launch-reference/administration/user-permissions.md).

## For independent developers

If you are an independent developer, or you are otherwise unable to join one of the partner programs listed and you would like to build extensions for Launch, please send an email to launch-ext-dev@adobe.com to request access. Please provide some background on your experience with Launch, and your planned extension project roadmap.
