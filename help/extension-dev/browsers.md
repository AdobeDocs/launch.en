>Adobe Experience Platform Launch is being rebranded as a suite of data collection technologies in Experience Platform. These changes will be rolling out across all product documentation in the coming weeks. Please refer to the following [document](../launch-term-updates.md) for a consolidated reference of the terminology changes.

- Chrome (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- IE (10 and above)
- Edge (latest)
- iOS Safari (latest)

Any extension code included in the runtime should also strive to support these browsers.
