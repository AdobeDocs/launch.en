# Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK extension overview

The Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK extension sends data to the Adobe Experience Cloud from web properties, through the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network. The Platform Web SDK extension allows for streaming data into platform, syncing identities, opt-in and automatically collecting context data. 

For details about configuring the Platform Web SDK extension, see the [Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/extension/web-sdk-extension.html?lang=en#extension).
