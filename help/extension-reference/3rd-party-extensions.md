# Third-Party extensions

If you own a [!DNL Launch] extension and need a place to provide documentation for it, please feel free to (1) add a sub-page with your documentation and (2) add the nav link in TOC.md.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>[!DNL Adobe] doesn't warranty the extensions from 3rd party developers, it's up to extension authors to choose a license and support process for their extensions. Many developers have chosen to post the source code of their extension packages on [!DNL Github], where customers can review them at their convenience. You can view those at [https://github.com/Launch-Developers](https://github.com/Launch-Developers).
