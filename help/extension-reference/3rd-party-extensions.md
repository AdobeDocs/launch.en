# Third-Party extensions

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe Experience Platform Launch is being rebranded as a suite of data collection technologies in Experience Platform. These changes will be rolling out across all product documentation in the coming weeks. Please refer to the following [document](../launch-term-updates.md) for a consolidated reference of the terminology changes.

In addition to extensions provided by Adobe solutions, third-party extensions for Adobe Experience Platform Launch are also available.

Adobe does not warranty the extensions from third-party developers, and there for it is the responsibility of extension authors to choose a license and support process for their extensions. Many developers have chosen to post the source code of their extension packages on a public GitHub repository where Platform Launch users can review them at their convenience. Refer to the [Launch Developers repo](https://github.com/Launch-Developers) for more information.
