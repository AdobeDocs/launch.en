>[!NOTE]

>Adobe Experience Platform Launch is being rebranded as a suite of data collection technologies in Experience Platform. These changes will be rolling out across all product documentation in the coming weeks. Please refer to the following [document](../../launch-term-updates.md) for a consolidated reference of the terminology changes.

The following documents contain information that is useful for tag administrators in Adobe Experience Platform:

* [User permissions](user-permissions.md): Learn about the user management process and the available access rights for tags.
* [Companies and properties](companies-and-properties.md): A property, or web property, is a collection of rules, data elements, configured extensions, environments, and libraries.
