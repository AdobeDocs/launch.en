# Adobe Experience Platform Launch terminology updates

Adobe Experience Platform Launch is being integrated into Adobe Experience Platform as a suite of data collection technologies. Rather than being a separate service from Experience Platform, Platform Launch's constituent features are now considered capabilities of Platform as a whole.

For this reason, Platform Launch and several related capabilities are being renamed and rebranded. The UI that provides Platform Launch capabilities has now been renamed as the Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection UI.

When directly referenced in the documentation, all of the terms listed below now refer to their rebranded counterparts as capabilities of Adobe Experience Platform.
