title: Adobe Experience Platform Launch name update
description: A complete list of terms and UI elements that are affected by the Adobe Experience Platform Launch rebranding.
---

Adobe Experience Platform Launch has been integrated into Adobe Experience Platform as a suite of data collection technologies. For this reason Platform Launch and several related capabilities are being renamed and rebranded.

The term Launch will now be referred to as tags if directly referenced in the documentation.

Launch is no longer to be considered a separate service under Adobe Experience Platform. Instead, its constituent features are capabilities of Adobe Experience Platform as a whole. The capabilities previously found using the Launch UI are now operated via the Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection UI.

[Launch Server Side](http://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/launch/using/server-side-info/server-side-overview.html) is being rebranded as Event Forwarding, and Edge configurations are now known as “datastreams”. For more information [read the datastream documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/fundamentals/datastreams.html).
