# Adobe Experience Platform Launch terminology update

Adobe Experience Platform Launch is being integrated into Adobe Experience Platform as a suite of data collection technologies. Rather than being a separate service from Experience Platform, Platform Launch's constituent features are now considered capabilities of Platform as a whole.

For this reason, Platform Launch and several related capabilities are being renamed and rebranded. The UI that provides Platform Launch capabilities has now been renamed as the Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection UI.

When directly referenced in the documentation, all of the listed terms now refer to their rebranded counterparts as a capability of Adobe Experience Platform.

| Previous term | Updated term |
|---|---|
| Launch server side | [event forwarding](./launch-reference/server-side-information/server-side-overview) |
| Edge configurations  |  [datastreams](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/fundamentals/datastreams.html) |
| Platform Launch | tags now refers to the tags capability provided by Experience Platform. |
