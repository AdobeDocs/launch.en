title: Adobe Experience Platform Launch name update
description: A complete list of terms and UI elements that are affected by the Adobe Experience Platform Launch rebranding.
---

Adobe Experience Platform Launch is being integrated into Adobe Experience Platform as a suite of data collection technologies. Launch is no longer to be considered a separate service under Adobe Experience Platform. Instead, its constituent features are capabilities of Adobe Experience Platform as a whole. As a result of this distinction between their previous pseudo-status as a service and new classification as a feature/capability, the Adobe Experience Platform feature names are not capitalized.

For this reason Platform Launch and several related capabilities are being renamed and rebranded. The UI that provides Platform Launch capabilities has now been renamed as the Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection UI.

When directly referenced in the documentation, "Platform Launch" now refers to the tags capability provided by Experience Platform.
