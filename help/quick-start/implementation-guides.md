# Implementation Guides

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe Experience Platform Launch is being rebranded as a suite of data collection technologies in Experience Platform. These changes will be rolling out across all product documentation in the coming weeks. Please refer to the following [document](../../launch-term-updates.md) for a consolidated reference of the terminology changes.

We have two implementation guides.  These are designed for front-end developers and technical marketers who want to learn how to implement the [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud] solutions in their sites and mobile applications.

* [Implementation guide for JavaScript in a browser](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-cloud/implementing-in-websites-with-launch/index.html)
* [Implementation with Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDKs in a native app](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/)
