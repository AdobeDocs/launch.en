* **General Availability: Launch Server Side** Send event-level data to the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network then use Launch Server Side to transform, enrich, and send that data to a non-Adobe endpoint using Adobe's servers, not the client, with low latency.
See [Launch Server Side overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/launch/using/server-side-info/server-side-overview.html?lang=en#server-side-info) and [Getting started with Experience Platform Launch Server Side](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/launch/using/server-side-info/server-side-getting-started.html?lang=en#server-side-info) for more information.
